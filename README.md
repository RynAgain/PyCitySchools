# PyCitySchools

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to use python and pandas to do two things.  First, exclude the scores for the 9th grade at Thomas High School by replacing them with "Nan".  Then perform an in-depth analysis on the rest of the data that remains.

## Results

### D1: Removing THS 9th Grade Reading & Math

In deliverable one, I used the pandas loc method to selectively edit the 9th grade Thomas High School reading and math school. All of these scores were changed to 'Nan' values, which effectively excludes them from all further calculations in the analysis.

### D2:  


## Summary

After excluding all the the test scores from Thomas High School(THS) 9th grade, several metrics for THS were negatively affected. In particular their ranking for overall percentage of passing students dropped from 2nd best to 8th worst.  They also dragged down the ratings for charter schools in their size range.
